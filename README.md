# Nomad: A Platform for Developers
**Nomad** is a two-week project built by four developers, graduating from an intense 14 week Full Stack JavaScript bootcamp.

Programming is problem solving, and we have experienced the value of studying and working together. It can be surprisingly enjoyable to follow along as someone is solving a problem, approaching it completely different than you would. Or to see someone approach the problem in a similar way, but subtly different. Our teamwork in the past months, and especially in the two weeks we took for this project, have convinced us of the need for a community around this phenomenon. **Nomad** provides the platform for this community.
